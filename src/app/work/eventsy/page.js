      <h1>About this Project</h1>
      <p>
        This Eventsy was a website I made in a web development bootcamp I took
        in the fall of 2023, and was the start of my more advanced website
        development techniques and software. This was made by replicating the
        website, and it's spacing using an Adobe XD file template.
      </p>
      <h1>Software used</h1>
      <p>
        Here are some of the tools and software that we used to make said
        database and front-end:
